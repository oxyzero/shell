## Introduction

Shell is a bootstrap for your terminal configuration, focusing on flexibility and modularity. Core features include:

- Similar environments in all platforms (Windows*, Linux, Mac)
- Highly customizable.
- Easy to setup, maintain, and expand.

Currently this package is under heavy development, therefore it might undergo some changes during this process.

## Installing

Currently you can only install Shell manually. More details will be given in the future about this process.

### Manual Installation

Clone this repository into your desired directory (the default path is `~/.shell`, you'll have to change the default path to yours in the `shell.sh` file).
Copy your `config.example.sh` to `config.sh` and apply your settings.
Edit your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` file to include at the end the following line: `source path-to-your-shell-folder`.

And that's it!
